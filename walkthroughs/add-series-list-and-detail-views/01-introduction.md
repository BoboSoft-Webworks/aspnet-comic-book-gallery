# Add Series List and Detail Views

## Introduction

In this step-by-step walkthrough, we’ll update the Comic Book Gallery website with a feature that will allow users to view the list of available series for our comic books.

To implement this feature, we’ll need to extend our data model, add a new repository, controller, and a couple of new views. Along the way, there’ll be lots of opportunity to practice what we’ve learned in the [ASP.NET MVC Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/aspnet-mvc-basics) course.
